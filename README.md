# buildbox-project
This is very similar to Travis-CI, except it is hosted on computers of oneâ€™s choice instead of the cloud. 
Since much of the work is done by running utility programs, we attempted to implement our own remote syncing of files and directories over TCP, much like the Unix utility rsync except cross-platform.

## Dependencies
* Python3.6
* socket
* textwrap
* threading
* json
* os
* shlex
* subprocess
* time
* hashlib
* argparse

## Quick start
Run the Server first then the Client.
Also, this is assuming you are running on the same machine

### Server
```
python buildbox.py server
```

### Client
```
python buildbox.py client 127.0.0.1 --root buildtest
```

## Important Tips
* buildbox.py is the wrapper class, so both the server and client runs on buildbox.py.
* As you can see in the Quick Start section, you can simply add the word server/client as the first argument to run the server/client.
* The second argument when running the client represents the host running buildbox in server mode (ex. 127.0.0.1)

## Server arguments
* -q OR --quiet 
Suppress output information
* -f OR --file JSONFILE 
The JSON config file to use (default buildbox.json)

## Client arguments
* -r OR --root DIR 
The directory to synchronize (default .)
* -q OR --quiet 
Suppress output information
* -d OR --dry-run 
Do not alter the server's state
* -n OR --no-build 
Synchronize files but do not run commands
